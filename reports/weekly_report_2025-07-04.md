## Styles

- `sqlite-lib/shell.c:8315`: Array index 'i' is used before limits check. (Defensive programming: The variable 'i' is used as an array index before it is checked that is within limits. This can mean that the array might be accessed out of bounds. Reorder conditions such as '(a[i] && i < 10)' to '(i < 10 && a[i])'. That way the array will not be accessed if the index is out of limits.)

## Portabilitys

- `sqlite-lib/sqlite3.c:26800`: Returning an integer in a function with pointer return type is not portable. (Returning an integer (int/long/etc) in a function with pointer return type is not portable across different platforms and compilers. For example in 32-bit Windows and Linux they are same width, but in 64-bit Windows and Linux they are of different width. In worst case you end up casting 64-bit integer down to 32-bit pointer. The safe way is to always return a pointer.)
